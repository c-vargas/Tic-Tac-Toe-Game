# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
A simple C++ program to play Tic-Tac-Toe.
The program lets two players play the Tic-Tac-Toe game on a 3 by 3 board.
You probably already know how to play Tic-Tac-Toe, but in case you don't...
The player who first fills the box with 3 X's or 3 O's in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal manner will win the game.
In some cases, when none of the players succeeds in filling the boxes horizontally, vertically, or diagonally with 3 X's or 3 O's, then the game will be considered to be a draw.
